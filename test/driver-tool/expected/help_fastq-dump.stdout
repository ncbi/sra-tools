                                     "chr1" or "1". "from" and "to" are
                                     1-based coordinates
     --matepair_distance <from-to|unknown>
                                   Filter by distance between matepairs. Use
                                     "unknown" to find matepairs split
                                     between the references. Use from-to to
                                     limit matepair distance on the same
                                     reference
     --skip-technical              Dump only biological reads
  -O|--outdir <path>               Output directory, default is working
                                     directory '.'
  -Z|--stdout                      Output to stdout, all split data become
                                     joined into single stream
     --gzip                        Compress output using gzip: deprecated,
                                     not recommended
     --bzip2                       Compress output using bzip2: deprecated,
                                     not recommended
     --split-files                 Write reads into separate files. Read
                                     number will be suffixed to the file
                                     name. NOTE! The `--split-3` option is
                                     recommended. In cases where not all
                                     spots have the same number of reads,
                                     this option will produce files that WILL
                                     CAUSE ERRORS in most programs which
                                     process split pair fastq files.
     --split-3                     3-way splitting for mate-pairs. For each
                                     spot, if there are two biological reads
                                     satisfying filter conditions, the first
                                     is placed in the `*_1.fastq` file, and
                                     the second is placed in the `*_2.fastq`
                                     file. If there is only one biological
                                     read satisfying the filter conditions,
                                     it is placed in the `*.fastq` file.All
                                     other reads in the spot are ignored.
  -G|--spot-group                  Split into files by SPOT_GROUP (member

                                     specified for translation or else
                                     specify "dflt" to use the default value

                                     more verbosity.
  -+|--debug <Module[-Flag]>[,...] Turn on debug output for module. All flags
