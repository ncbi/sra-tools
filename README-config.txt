About configuration-assistant:
configuration-assistant.perl will help you to configure the SRA tools to be able to access
the local reference repository and to download the correct references for a given cSRA file.


To run configuration-assistant:
- open Command Prompt (Start->Run->cmd.exe),
- change directory to the folder where you extracted the toolkit (cd ...\sratoolkit.2.1.7-win32),
- type 'perl configuration-assistant.perl' (without the quotation marks).


If the following message shows up:

  "'perl' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
    operable program or batch file."

that means perl is not installed or not installed properly.
