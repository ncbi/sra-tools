## The SRA Toolkit
The SRA Toolkit and SDK from NCBI is a collection of tools and libraries for
using data in the INSDC Sequence Read Archives.

### ANNOUNCEMENT:
NIH has released a request for information (RFI) to solicit community feedback on new proposed Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data formats. Learn more and share your thoughts at https://go.usa.gov/xvhdr. The response deadline is July 17th, 2020. Weâ€™d encourage you all to share with your colleagues and networks, and respond if you are an SRA submitter or data user.

SRA Toolkit 2.10.8
kproc, fasterq-dump: fixed problem with seg-faults caused by too small stack used by threads
kdbmeta: allow to work with remote runs
kdb, vdb, vfs, sra-tools: fixed bug preventing use of path to directory created by prefetch if it ends with '/'
vfs, sra-tools, ngs-tools: report an error when file was encrypted for a different ngc file
prefetch: print error message when cannot resolve reference sequence
vfs, prefetch: download encrypted phenotype files with encrypted extension
vdb, sra-docker: config can auto-generate LIBS/GUID when in a docker container

`fastq-dump` is still supported as it handles more corner cases than `fasterq-dump`, but it is likely to be deprecated in the future.

You can get more information about `fasterq-dump` in our Wiki at [https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/HowTo:-fasterq-dump](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/HowTo:-fasterq-dump).
