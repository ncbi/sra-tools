# Generate and compare loader QA statistics.

### Testing `qa-stat`

There is a script `make-test-input.pl` that will generate test records. This
script also adds comments to the file with some stats. These could be used to
verify some of the stats generated by `qa-stats`. There is a script `reverse.pl`
that will reverse complement all sequence reads (alignment reads are unchanged).
You can reorder with `sort --random-sort`. The result of `reverse.pl` or of
reordering (or any combination) should not cause any differences in the
statistics.

It is easy to get real differences in the statistics. For example, use different
parts of the input.
